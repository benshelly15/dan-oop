# Shape Classifier

First things first, clone this repo and create a branch called `dan`. When you have finished the task raise a pull request on `main`. If this doesn't make sense, read over the git tutorial again!

Create a program that output stats about a shape. The program will take in the lengths of each side of a shape and output its:

* Name
* Area
* Interior Angle

This should work for all types of triangles and quadrilaterals as well as regular polygons up to 6 sides.

Remember what you've learned from the OOP stuff and try and apply SOLID principles, good luck :)
