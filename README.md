# Shape Classifier

First things first, clone this repo and create a branch called `dan`. When you have finished the task raise a pull request on `main`. If this doesn't make sense, read over the git tutorial again!

Create a program that output stats about a shape. The program will take in the lengths of each side of a shape and output its:

* Name
* Area 
* Interior Angle
(Not really too bothered if the maths isn't *perfect* - don't spend too much time trying to get the maths of it right. More interested in the code!)

This should work for all types of triangles and quadrilaterals as well as regular polygons up to 6 sides.

Triangles:
* Equilateral
* Right Angled
* Isosceles
* Scalene

Quadrialterals:
* Square
* Rectangle
* Rhombus
* Parallelogram
* Kite

Regular Pentagon &
Regular Hexagon

Remember what you've learned from the OOP stuff and try and apply SOLID principles, good luck :)
